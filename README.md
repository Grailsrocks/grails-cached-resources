# Cached Resources

This plugin calculates SHA256 hashes of your static resources and renames them to include this hash.

It then sets long term caching headers on the resources when rendering them.

*Note* This plugin is no longer maintained or supported by the author (Marc Palmer). Please see the new repository at [http://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-cached-resources]
